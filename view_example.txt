-- creating views

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW dept_costs AS
SELECT d.department_name, SUM(e.salary) AS dept_total
FROM employees e JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_name;
-- SELECT * FROM dept_costs;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW avg_cost AS
SELECT SUM(dept_total)/COUNT(*) AS dept_avg FROM dept_costs;
-- SELECT * FROM avg_cost;

-- using the views in a query
SELECT * FROM dept_costs
WHERE dept_total  > (SELECT dept_avg FROM avg_cost);

-- easier to understand
WITH

--Without the WITH clause
